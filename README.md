### Hi there! 😁

My name is Rod Andrade from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2012. 

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
